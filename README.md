# NYC Motor Vehichle Collision Web App

This project is a Streamlit dashboard that allows users to analyse motor vehicle collisions in New York City. It was built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users understand vehicle collision patterns, identify dangerous areas, and explore the relationship between collisions and factors such as time of day.

## Features
The NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Dashboard offers the following features:

**Overview:** Provides summary statistics and a sample of the collision data, as well as a map displaying all collisions.

**Injuries Map:** Allows users to filter the data based on the number of injured persons and visualise the results on an interactive map.

**Collisions by Time:** Enables users to explore the number of collisions occurring during a specific hour of the day. The data is visualised on a 3D hexagon layer map and a histogram showing the breakdown of collisions by minute within the selected hour.

**Dangerous Streets:** Displays the top 10 dangerous streets based on the number of affected pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists.

**Raw Data:** Provides access to the raw collision data for further analysis.
